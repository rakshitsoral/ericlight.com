&lt;p&gt;I've never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; run a blog before... I did write a bunch of stuff back when I ran Gravity Computing; it just was never really "bloggy".  That content has now been moved to &lt;a href="http://www.efficientsoftware.co.nz/blog/"&gt;Efficient Software&lt;/a&gt;, but I'll probably copy my parts back over here when time permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really have no intention of running a blog, but I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; come across interesting and challenging problems &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;, which I'd like to share with people who are, apparently, just like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got a couple things saved up that I want to post about in the next few days, but heck this site could languish for months at a time -- so feel free to add it to your reader, I definitely won't fill your feed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
