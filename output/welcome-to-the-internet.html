    <p>Well, I'm finally here.</p>
<p>I've never <em>really</em> run a blog before... I did write a bunch of stuff back when I ran Gravity Computing; it just was never really "bloggy".  That content has now been moved to <a href="http://www.efficientsoftware.co.nz/blog/">Efficient Software</a>, but I'll probably copy my parts back over here when time permits.</p>
<p>I really have no intention of running a blog, but I <strong>do</strong> come across interesting and challenging problems <em>all the time</em>, which I'd like to share with people who are, apparently, just like you.</p>
<p>I've got a couple things saved up that I want to post about in the next few days, but heck this site could languish for months at a time -- so feel free to add it to your reader, I definitely won't fill your feed.</p>
