There are a bunch of fantastic Capture The Flag security challenges on [RingZer0Team.com](https://www.ringzer0team.com).  I've been working through some of these for a wee while now, and with the [New Zealand Cyber Security Challenge](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.org.nz/) coming up again soon, I thought I'd get back into some of them.

Challenge 56 ("Hash Breaker", under the Coding Challenges) is one of a series of challenges where you're simply presented with a hash - you need to return the plaintext value to the page within 3 seconds.

Of course, this is impossible to do manually, so it's a programming challenge.

The hash looks like a simple SHA-1, so I put it into an online hash reverser and discovered it's just a SHA1 hash of a random number.  SHA1 is really fast, so this should be simple.

Here's how I tackled the problem:

	#!python
	# It's in Python3, because of reasons
	from requests import get
	from hashlib import sha1
	from re import search
	calculated_hash=''
	x=0
	
	# Your session cookie needs to go here
	session=dict(PHPSESSID='<cookie contents>')

	# Load the web page
	url='https://ringzer0team.com/challenges/56'
	resp=get(url,cookies=session)

	# Extract the hash from the page contents
	target_hash=resp.text.split("-----")[2].split("\t")[2].split("<")[0]

	# Iterate hashes from zero until the calculated hash matches the target hash
	while calculated_hash != target_hash:
    		calculated_hash=sha1(str(x).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    		print("%s = %s" % (calculated_hash, x))
    		x+=1
	
	# If we got here, yay!  We found the key.  Now submit it back to the site, and print our magic flag
	resp=get(url+'/'+str(x-1),cookies=session)
	flag=search("FLAG-.{24}",resp.text).group()
	print(flag)
	
There's no error handling in that code, so if it runs for more than a few seconds it's probably toast.
