This is a continuation of my series on [RingZer0Team.com](https://www.ringzer0team.com).  

Challenge 65 ("Hide my ass in my home", under the Forensic challenges) is a nice quick little forensic challenge.  You get to download a .tar file, and do a bit of digging to uncover the flag.

This was a nice easy few minutes.  After downloading the archive, I discovered a few files inside - including a _particularly groovy_ electronica swing track, which I'm listening to again right now.  Yeaaaaahhhhh.

Apart from a groovy mp3, the archive contains some dot-files such as .bash_history, a .jpg picture, an index.html, and some other bits.

I found the Flag in one of the dot-files; specifically, it was inside a Vim swap file that seemed to be leftover from a power failure or similar.
