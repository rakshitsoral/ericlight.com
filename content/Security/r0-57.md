This is a continuation of my series on [RingZer0Team.com](https://www.ringzer0team.com).  

Challenge 57 ("Hash Breaker Reloaded", under the Coding Challenges) is one of a series of challenges where you're simply presented with a hash - you need to return the plaintext value to the page within 3 seconds.

In contrast to [Challenge 56]({filename}/Security/r0-56.md), **this** challenge also includes a salt:

	You have 3 seconds to break this hash
	Send the answer back using https://ringzer0team.com/challenges/57/[clear_text]
	
	
	----- BEGIN HASH -----
	ab9507edbb2501b3c02e47c51af0178d68655980
	----- END HASH -----
	
	----- BEGIN SALT -----
	c2ac9d8d004b4011d0864e76c7ebaaccfd18464bb8ff66bdbf19a703eb95a944
	----- END SALT -----


The hash looks like another SHA-1, but of course the online hash reversers don't have the *now-salted* hash in their rainbow tables.  I figured that the challenge was a simple continuation of the previous challenge, so I crossed my fingers and guessed the hash was simply a number (from last time), concatenated with the plain-text salt.

... And I was lucky!  The below code got me the flag: 
	
	#!/usr/bin/python3
	from requests import get
	from hashlib import sha1
	from re import search
	
	url='https://ringzer0team.com/challenges/57'
	session=dict(PHPSESSID='<blahblah>')
	resp=get(url,cookies=session)
	hash=resp.text.split("-----")[2].split("\t")[2].split("<")[0]
	salt=resp.text.split("-----")[6].split("\t")[2].split("<")[0]
	newhash=''
	salt=salt.encode('utf-8')
	x=0
	while newhash != hash:
    		newhash=sha1(str(x).encode('utf-8')+salt).hexdigest()
    		print("%s = %s" % (newhash, x))
    		x+=1
		
	resp=get(url+'/'+str(x-1),cookies=session)
	flag=search("FLAG-.{24}",resp.text).group()
	print(flag)
	
	
As last time, there's no error handling in that code, so if it runs for more than a few seconds it's probably toast.
