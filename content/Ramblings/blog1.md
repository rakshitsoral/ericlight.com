Title: Welcome to the Internet
Author: Eric Light

Well, I'm finally here.

I've never *really* run a blog before... I did write a bunch of stuff back when I ran Gravity Computing; it just was never really "bloggy".  That content has now been moved to [Efficient Software](http://www.efficientsoftware.co.nz/blog/), but I'll probably copy my parts back over here when time permits.

I really have no intention of running a blog, but I **do** come across interesting and challenging problems *all the time*, which I'd like to share with people who are, apparently, just like you.

I've got a couple things saved up that I want to post about in the next few days, but heck this site could languish for months at a time -- so feel free to add it to your reader, I definitely won't fill your feed.
