What do you do when it's dinner time, and you haven't got any ingredients ready for the meal?

What if (perhaps as a result of being an ultralight hiker), you also have a huge surplus 500g sachet of tuna?

Tonight these particular stars aligned, and I ended up making these amazing Tuna Patties: <http://allrecipes.com.au/recipe/15705/tuna-patties.aspx>

I did tweak the recipe considerably, though:

Ingredients:
------------

* 2-3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed for mashing
* Optionally, swap one of the potatoes for a kumara or some pumpkin
* 500g tuna flakes
* 2 carrots, grated and excess juice dabbed out with a paper towel
* A goodly handful of frozen chopped spinach
* 1 onion, cubed
* 3 garlic cloves, chopped
* 1/8th tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp basil
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp sage
* 1 tsp veggie stock powder
* 2 eggs
* 2 tbsp mustard


Method:
-------

* Boil the potatoes in salted water until cooked.
* In another pan, fry the onions for 2 minutes, then add garlic.  
* Fry until the onions start to brown, then add herbs, spices, and stock powder.
* Continue to fry for another minute, then remove from heat and let cool.
* When the potatoes are cooked, tip out **all** the water, and allow remaning water to evaporate.
* Mash the potatoes - they'll seem unpleasantly dry, but that's OK.
* Mix the carrots, mashed potatoes, fried onion and garlic, all together in a bowl.
* In another bowl, mix together the tuna, the eggs, and the mustard.
* Now combine everything together, and give it a good mix.
* Form the mixture into patties and fry in a lightly oiled pan.

In retrospect, this recipe seems really difficult, but it was actually quite straightforward, and it was totally delicious.  Definitely good with a bit of mayo on the patties.  Yummo!
