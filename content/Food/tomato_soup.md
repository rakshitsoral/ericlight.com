I came home tonight to discover my wife had made probably the most amazing tomato soup I've ever tasted.  She performed this feat with about ten minutes of effort (plus about an hour of simmering), so I decided I needed to note it down.

Ingredients
===========

* 1 Tbsp oil
* 1 medium onion, sliced
* 1/2 head of garlic, peeled and chopped
* About 4 slices of bacon, diced
* 3 cans of chopped tomatoes
* 2 tsp of vegetable stock powder
* 2 tsp of sugar
* 1 cup of water
* Cream
* Parsley for garnish

Method
======

1. Get yourself a piping-hot frying pan
1. Add the oil and the onion; fry until transluscent
1. Add the garlic and the bacon; fry until bacon starts to brown
1. Add chopped tomatoes, veggie stock, and water; stir
1. Simmer for at least 45 minutes; preferrably longer
1. Serve with a dollop of cream, and garnish with parsley

That's it!  It's hands-down delicious.
