Jeez I just discovered I've only posted a single recipe on this.  Time to change that.

Chicken for dinner tonight.  I was feeling a little adventurous, and definitely wanted some miso involved, but also felt like cayenne pepper and shallow-fried chicken strips.  Here's the result!  This went really well on a base of bulgur wheat, and with a side of stir fried veggies.

Ingredients
-----------
* Two chicken breasts, skinless
* 2 tsp miso paste
* 2/3 cup plain flour
* 2 tsp celery salt
* 1 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp chicken stock powder
* 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp black pepper


Method
------

* Cut the chicken into strips, sized similarly to your two thumbs together.
* Sift all the dry ingredients into a bowl, and stir or shake until mixed.
* **Taste your flour coating!!**  Make sure it's delicious, and make sure it's spicy enough.
* Mix your miso paste with a little hot water until smooth.  **It should be quite thick**, you don't want it dripping off.
* Coat all the chicken in the miso paste.
* Roll the chicken strips in the flour until thoroughly coated.
* Pan-fry in a very hot pan, for about 2 minutes per side.

Enjoy!
