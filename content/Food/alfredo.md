I had the urge to make a homemade alfredo the other night.  I found a recipe called ["Better than Olive Garden Alfredo Sauce"](http://www.food.com/recipe/better-than-olive-garden-alfredo-sauce-141983), which is pretty descriptive, I guess.  I made a couple tweaks here and there, though.

I usually stray wildly from recipies whenever I decide to follow one, but having not made an alfredo sauce before, I largely stuck to the guide.  A couple changes I did make, though:

* Instead of adding the garlic and cream together, I heated the butter and _fried_ the garlic to bring out a bit more flavour
* I also fried a goodly dose of smoked bacon along with the garlic.  Bacon first, of course, so the garlic doesn't burn
* The recipe reckoned we should use two garlic cloves.  Ha!  Four, definitely.
* I also added some chopped spring onion and a pinch of cayenne pepper

I've reproduced the origina recipe, along with my changes, here:

Ingredients
-----------

* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 or 3 rashers of bacon, chopped into squares
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 chopped spring onion
* 2 cups cream
* 1⁄4 teaspoon freshly-ground pepper
* 1 pinch cayenne pepper
* 1⁄2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 3⁄4 cup mozzarella cheese
* 1 1/2 supermarket tubes of fettucini pasta

Method
------

Melt butter in medium saucepan with olive oil over medium/low heat.  
Fry the bacon until until browned.  
Add the garlic, fry until the garlic starts to brown.  
Add cream and spring onion; bring mixture to a simmer.  
Stir often.  
Add the Parmesan cheese and simmer sauce for 8-10 minutes or until sauce has thickened and is smooth.  
When sauce has thickened add the Mozzarella cheese and stir until smooth. STIR FREQUENTLY.  
Add the pepper and cayenne.  
While the sauce cooks, boil noodles for 3-5 minutes.  
Place pasta on serving plates and spoon sauce over pasta.
